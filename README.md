App with GUI.<br>
The app tracks the amount of time spent on all windows/apps on computer since "start".<br>
The app produces a histogram featuring the number of minutes spent on each window/app when the user presses "stop".<br>
The goal is for the user to identify and change how they allocate their time online.<br>
